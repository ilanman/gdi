## Tech requirements

1. Python 2.7 installed and working. If you have Python 3, that's fine, but note that are some minor differences that we can address in class. 
2. Install the following Python packages:  `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib `, `sklearn`, `ipython`
  -  You can use [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for each of them. `pip install numpy` should work for example, once you download `pip`.
  -  You can download the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Anaconda might be a better alternative for those with Windows computers or who aren't comfortable downloading development packages.
3. [`Jupyter`](http://jupyter.org/) notebook. This is critical. Rather than using a text editor, we'll be using the notebook exclusively in this class. This is also installed using `pip`. Please spend a few minutes browsing the Jupyter website. Note that IPython comes with Anaconda as well.

If you have any issues getting this software installed, we will have an install fest on July 7th at 5:30pm, right before the first class.

To see if things work, you should be able to perform the following operations:

1) Open a terminal<br>
2) Type in `python`<br>
3) Check if the following imports work:<br>

4) If you are able to do those without error, then great! If you cannot, then try reinstalling those modules, either individually or through Anaconda. Email me if you have problems at this point.

When you do that successfully, then:

5) cd into a project folder, such as  `pythongdi`<br>
6) `git clone https://github.com/ilanman/gdi`<br>
7) Here you should see something like:<br>

Note that you won't see `01_Week1_I.ipynb` or `02_Week1_II.ipynb` yet.

8) From here you should be able to type: `jupyter notebook` and your internet browser should automatically load a screen like this:

9) Then click on the `00_Week0_I.ipynb` and you should see this:

10) Run the first cell (with the imports). You can run a cell by holding the `shift + return` key. If you don't get an error, then you're ready to go!

If that didn't work for you, then send me a quick email and I'll try to help you before the first day. Otherwise, plan to show up at 5:30 and we'll do it together.
