Tech requirements

1. Python 2.7 installed and working. If you have Python 3, that's fine, but note that are some minor differences that we can address in class. 
2. Install the following Python packages:  numpy, pandas, matplotlib 
You can use pip install for each of them or follow the documentation as necessary. Alternatively, download the Anaconda package manager from here. 
3. IPython notebook (i.e.. Jupyter). This is critical. Rather than using a text editor, we'll be using the notebook exclusively in this class. This is also installed using pip. Please spend a few minutes browsing the Jupyter website. Note that IPython comes with Anaconda as well.

If you have any issues getting this software installed, we will have an install fest on July 7th at 5:30pm, right before the first class.

To see if things work, you should be able to perform the following operations:

1) Open a terminal
2) type in python
3) Check if the following imports work:

4) If you are able to do those without error, then great! If you cannot, then you need to try reinstalling those modules, either individually or through Anaconda.

When you do that successfully, then:

5) cd into a project folder, such as  pythongdi
6) git clone https://github.com/ilanman/gdi
7) here you should see something like:

Note that you won't see 01_Week1_I.ipynb or 02_Week1_II.ipynb yet.

8) from here you should be able to type: "jupyter notebook" and your internet browser should automatically load a screen like this:

9) Then click on the 00_Week0_I.ipynb and you should see this:

10) Run the first cell (with the imports). You can run a cell by holding the shift + return key. If you don't get an error, then you're ready to go!

If that didn't work for you, then send me a quick email and I'll try to help you before the first day. Otherwise, plan to show up at 5:30 and we'll do it together.
